# Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Data
United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) [handbook](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/taskteams/satellite/UNGWG_Satellite_Task_Team_Report_WhiteCover.pdf) for creating statistics using satellite images.

This handbook, written by members of the United Nations Task Team on Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Data, provides a guide for National Statistical Offices considering using satellite imagery (known as earth observations) data for official statistics. It was produced as an input to the United Nation Global Working Group on Big Data for Official Statistics report to the United Nations Statistical Commission for 2017.
 
The handbook provides a brief introduction to the use of earth observations (EO) data for official statistics, types of sources available and methodologies for producing statistics from this type of data. It also summarises the results of four pilot projects produced by Task Team members; Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Australia, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografíca e Informática (INEGI), Mexico, Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE), Colombia and Google. Supplementary material includes a methodology literature review, and the full reports of the pilot projects.
 
In the final chapter, guidelines are presented for National Statistical Offices to consider and refer to when considering whether to implement earth observations data sources into their statistical production process, and issues to consider throughout the implementation and output processes. Rather than being prescriptive, the guidelines are intended to prompt National Statistical Office to critically consider their own business needs and apply the recommendations as appropriate to their circumstances. As the international experience using these data for statistical purposes grows, National Statistical Offices can build on the guidelines provided in this handbook with their own expertise and knowledge.
# Mobile Phone Data
United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) [handbook](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/taskteams/mobilephone/Handbook%20on%20Mobile%20Phone%20Data%20for%20official%20statistics%20-%20Draft%20Nov%202017.pdf) for creating statistics using mobile phone data.

The Task Team on Mobile Phone Data has been reviewing development in the usage of mobile phone data for official statistics and drafted this guide to give elaborations for countries which are in the design or implementation process for projects using mobile phone data for their official statistics. The guide is to be published only in electronic format and in English and is expected to be reviewed and amended as projects are being advanced.
